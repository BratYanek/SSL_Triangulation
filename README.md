Using the estimated DoA data from a single node, the location of the sound source is calculated.

The project was created based on:

    https://github.com/pytorch/audio/blob/master/examples/interactive_asr/vad.py#L38
    https://github.com/BrownsugarZeer/Multi_SSL
    https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/speechbrain/processing/multi_mic.py
